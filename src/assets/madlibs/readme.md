# Madlibs syntax

## The syntax for madlibs is pretty simple. just use `[[name]]` and replace name with what the type of the word will be. like `past tense verb`, `number`, `place` etc. it can be anything. the reason I use `[[]]` with 2 brackets and not 1 is because you may want to use 1 for other purposes.
