History is [[adjective]] because we learn about [[noun]] and [[nouns]] that happened long ago. I can't believe people used to dress in [[adjective]] clothing and kids played with [[nouns]] and [[nouns]] instead of video games. Also, before cars were invented, people actually rode [[animals]]! People read [[nouns]] instead of computers and tablets, and sent messages via [[nouns]] that took [[number]] days to arrive. I wonder how kids will view my life in [[number]] year(s); maybe they will ride flying cars to school and play with [[nouns]] and [[adjective]] [[nouns]]
