We're no strangers to love
{} knows the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
{} wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell {} how I'm feeling
Gotta make {} understand
Never gonna give {} up
Never gonna let {} down
Never gonna run around and desert {}
Never gonna make {} cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt {}
We've known each other for so long
{}'s heart's been aching but {} is too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it
And if {} ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me {} is too blind to see
Never gonna give {} up
Never gonna let {} down
Never gonna run around and desert {}
Never gonna make {} cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt {}
Never gonna give {} up
Never gonna let {} down
Never gonna run around and desert {}
Never gonna make {} cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt {}
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give {} up)
