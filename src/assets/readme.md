# What all the assets folders are

## assets/data/

This folder has some data that the bot needs in order to invoke certain commands. such as a `httpexception_codes.json` file to send a response to the user when we get a httpexception

## assets/error/

This folder has the templates and css files used by the error reports the bot generates

## assets/madlibs/

This folder stores the madlibs used by the bot's madlibs command. you can also add your own custom madlibs and open a pull request. for the syntax see [madlibs/readme.md](madlibs/readme.md)

## assets/sounds/

This folder contains the sounds played by the bot when it starts, these aren't necessary and can be removed but I just like to have some audio confirmation
